# Alice
This is a mobile application for doctors that priorize patients with a neurological condition called Todd’s Syndrome according to the Manchester Protocol for risk classification. Todd’s syndrome, more frequently referred to as Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS), is a disorienting neurological condition that primarily targets children. AIWS affects human visual perception and involves an array of symptoms that include transient altered perception of the shapes of inanimate and animate objects that appear to be smaller (micropsia) or larger (macropsia) than normal. 

Currently, the application uses the following informations to determine the likelihood:

●  Many patients with this disorder also have migraines;

●  People 15 years old or younger are more likely to have it;

●  There are more documented cases of men having it than woman;

●  Usage of hallucinogenic drugs increases the probability;

Someone that matches all of those factors is 100% likely to have the disorder. Matching two of them leads to a 50% probability. Matching none means 0% likely to have it.
